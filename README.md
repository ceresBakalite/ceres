**ceres** is a quite simple set of short, sharp functions showing a means to handle doubly linked lists in a human 
readable way.

### Summary<img class="img-pointer" align="left" src="https://github.com/ceresBakalite/ceres-sv/raw/main/images/CSVPeriscope.png">

To be fair to the humble array, once nesting (the means to hold arrays within arrays) became common place, the map 
method was inevitable.  Whether it adds, or for that matter simplifies, a great deal towards the art of array 
manipulation is open to debate.
     
The functions presented here, although primitive, began life as the basis for handling large JSON lists. The text-based
structure of these lists is highly conducive to modelling one to *n* data constructs and these simple routines can be 
particularly useful when required to traverse and manage representations of particularly long cartesian joins.
