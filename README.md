     To be fair to the humble array, once nesting (the means to hold arrays within arrays) became common place, the map
     method was inevitable.  Whether it adds, or for that matter simplifies, a great deal towards the art of array
     manipulation is open to debate.
     
     What is presented here is a simple set of short, sharp functions showing a means to handle doubly linked lists in a 
     human readable way.
     
     The functions presented here have been used as the basis for handling large JSON lists as their text based structure 
     is highly conducive to managing one to one, one to many, and many to many data constructs.
