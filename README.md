**ceres** is a very simple set of short, sharp functions showing a means to handle doubly linked lists in a human 
readable way.

### Summary<img class="img-pointer" align="left" src="https://github.com/ceresBakalite/ceres-sv/raw/main/images/CSVPeriscope.png">

To be fair to the humble array, once nesting (the means to hold arrays within arrays) became common place, the map 
method was inevitable.  Whether it adds, or for that matter simplifies, a great deal towards the art of array 
manipulation is open to debate.
     
The functions presented here have been used as the basis for handling large JSON lists as their text based structure 
is highly conducive to managing one to *n* data constructs and can be particularly useful when traversing long 
cartesian joins.
