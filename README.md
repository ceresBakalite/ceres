**ceres** presents a simple set of short, sharp functions showing a means to handle doubly linked lists in a human 
readable way.

### Progress<img class="img-pointer" align="left" src="/images/CSVPeriscope.png">

     To be fair to the humble array, once nesting (the means to hold arrays within arrays) became common place, the map
     method was inevitable.  Whether it adds, or for that matter simplifies, a great deal towards the art of array
     manipulation is open to debate.
     
     The functions presented here have been used as the basis for handling large JSON lists as their text based structure 
     is highly conducive to managing one to one, one to many, and many to many data constructs.
